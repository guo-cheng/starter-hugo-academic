abstract: Various insect species including moths have shown significant foraging preference to acetic acid. However, the olfactory reception and behavioral outputs of acetic acid in moths remain unsolved. The female adults of Oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, exhibit high preference to acetic acid enriched sweet vinegar solutions, making them good targets for exploration of acid reception and performance. We first proved that acetic acid is an essential component which elicited electrophysiological responses from volatiles of the sweet vinegar solution. Successive single sensillum recording tests showed that at least 4 types (as1, as2, as3, and as4) of sensilla were involved in acetic acid reception in the antennae. The low dosages of acetic acid elicited upwind flight and close search, and pre-contact proboscis extension responses of the fasted females, indicating it serves as a food related olfactory cue. In vivo optical imaging data showed that low dosages of acetic acid activated one ordinary glomerulus (DC3), and high dosages evoked additional two glomeruli (DC1 and AC1) in the antennal lobe. A systematic survey on olfaction related receptors in three related transcriptomes has yielded 67 olfactory receptors (ORs) and 19 ionotropic receptors (IRs). Among, MsepIR8a, MsepIR64a, MsepIR75q1, and MsepIR75q2 were chosen as putative acid receptors by blasting against known acid IRs in Drosophila and comparing essential amino acid residues which related to acid sensing. Later in situ hybridization revealed that MsepIr8a was co-expressed with each of the other 3 Irs, suggesting its putative co-receptor role. This study reveals olfactory reception of acetic acid as an attractant in M. separata, and it provides the solid basis for later deorphanization of relevant receptors.
